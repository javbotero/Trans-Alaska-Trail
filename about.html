<p>The Trans-Alaska Trail project is a partnership between the office of
Representative Jonathan Kreiss-Tomkins (where project planning began in November
2014), Valdez-based economic diversification organization Levitation 49, and
collaborators across Alaska and the United States. The team of collaborators
continues to grow with each passing month.</p>

<p>A huge cadre of people &mdash; agency staff and leadership at Alaska DNR and BLM,
GIS techs at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, trail experts and consultants
in Alaska and throughout the U.S., graphic designers, architects, and more &mdash;
have lent time and expertise to vet and develop the Trans-Alaska Trail vision.
Energized by the vision, all private sector collaborators have worked pro
bono.</p>

<p>After 17 months of diligence and hundreds (going on thousands) of hours of
work, we’ve determined the Trans-Alaska Trail is viable and merits further
investment of effort and resources. We’ve also identified myriad questions and
concerns that merit answers and solutions. We’re excited to find those answers
and create those solutions, and the path forward will require inclusive and
collaborative stakeholder work, especially with Alyeska.</p>

<h2>Chronology</h2>
<h4>The Trans-Alaska Trail team has:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    reviewed state and federal right-of-way leases, Department of Homeland Security
regulations, and multiple legal analyses to determine the compatibility of
recreation along the right-of-way;
  </li>
  <li>
    developed working partnerships with BLM Alaska, BLM leadership in D.C., Alaska
DNR, communities and businesses along the trail corridor,  local and national
outdoor and recreation groups, the national outdoor industry, trail consultants
and experts, and the Alaska adventure tourism sector;
  </li>
  <li>
    initiated dialogue with Alyeska and discussed a solution-oriented path forward;
  </li>
  <li>
    identified, ground-truthed, and photodocumented a 66-mile “pilot segment,”
running from Valdez to the Little Tonsina River (mile 63 of the Richardson
Highway). This pilot segment was chosen because of its spectacular scenic
beauty, community support in Valdez, relative simplicity of land ownership, and
because the pipeline runs underground for the entirety of the segment,
mitigating security considerations;
  </li>
  <li>
    identified capital improvements for sections of the Valdez-to-Little Tonsina
pilot segment where the route is discontinuous (e.g., two large river
crossings), and, working with trail consultants, estimated the cost of those
capital improvements;
  </li>
  <li>
    held an open house in Valdez to broaden community conversation on the
Trans-Alaska Trail idea.
  </li>
</ul>
