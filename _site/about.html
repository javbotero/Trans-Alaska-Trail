        <p>The idea originates with the office of
Representative Jonathan Kreiss-Tomkins, where planning
began in November 2014. The project has progressed to
include a team of collaborators from Alaska and beyond.</p>

<p>A huge cadre of people — agency staff and
leadership at Alaska DNR and BLM, GIS techs at
the University of Alaska Fairbanks, trail experts and
consultants in Alaska and throughout the U.S., graphic
designers, architects, and more — have lent time and
expertise to vet and develop this idea. All non-public
sector collaborators have worked pro bono, energized by
the vision.</p>

<h2>Chronology</h2>

<p>After 15 months of diligence, and hundreds
(going on thousands) of hours of work, the
determination has been made that Trans-Alaska Trail is
feasible and viable. It will require important stakeholder
work, as initial conversations with Alyeska have
indicated, and attention to myriad details, but the idea
merits advancement.</p>

<h4>The Trans-Alaska Trail team has:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>reviewed state and federal right-of-way leases, including
multiple legal analyses (two more are pending), as well
as Department of Homeland Security regulations to
determine the compatibility of recreation along the TAPS
right-of-way;</li>

<li>developed working partnerships with BLM Alaska, BLM
leadership in D.C., Alaska DNR, communities along the
trail corridor, trail consultants, and the Alaska adventure
tourism sector;</li>

<li>initiated dialogue with Alyeska;</li>

<li>identified, ground-truthed, and photodocumented a
66-mile “pilot segment,” running from Valdez to the Little
Tonsina River (mile 63 of the Richardson Highway). This
pilot segment was chosen because of its spectacular
scenic beauty, community support in Valdez, relative
simplicity of land ownership, and because the TAPS runs
underground for the entirety of the segment, mitigating
security considerations;</li>

<li>identified capital improvements for sections of the
Valdez-to-Little Tonsina pilot segment where the service
pad is discontinuous (e.g., two large river crossings), and,
working with trail consultants, estimated the cost of those
capital improvements.</li>
