        <p>The idea for the Trans-Alaska Trail originates from the office of Representative
Jonathan Kreiss-Tomkins, where planning began in November 2014. The team of
collaborators has since grown across Alaska and the Lower 48.</p>

<p>A huge cadre of people &mdash; agency staff and leadership at Alaska DNR and
BLM, GIS techs at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, trail experts and
consultants in Alaska and throughout the U.S., graphic designers, architects,
and more &mdash; have lent time and expertise to vet and develop the Trans-Alaska
Trail vision. Energized by the vision, all private sector collaborators have
worked pro bono.</p>

<p>After 17 months of diligence and hundreds (going on thousands) of hours of
work, we’ve determined the Trans-Alaska Trail is feasible and viable. We’ve
also identified myriad questions and concerns that merit answers and solutions.
We’re excited to find those answers and create those solutions, and the path
forward will require inclusive and collaborative stakeholder work, especially
with Alyeska.</p>

<h2>Chronology</h2>
<h4>The Trans-Alaska Trail team has:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>
    reviewed state and federal right-of-way leases, Department of Homeland
    Security regulations, and multiple legal analyses to determine
    the compatibility of recreation along the right-of-way;
  </li>
  <li>
    developed working partnerships with BLM Alaska, BLM leadership in D.C.,
    Alaska DNR, communities and businesses along the trail corridor, local and
    national outdoor and recreation groups, national outdoor industry, trail
    consultants and experts, and Alaska adventure tourism sector;
  </li>
  <li>
    initiated dialogue with Alyeska and discussed a solution-oriented path
    forward;
  </li>
  <li>
    identified, ground-truthed, and photodocumented a 66-mile “pilot segment,”
running from Valdez to the Little Tonsina River (mile 63 of the Richardson
Highway). This pilot segment was chosen because of its spectacular scenic
beauty, community support in Valdez, relative simplicity of land ownership, and
because the pipeline runs underground for the entirety of the segment,
mitigating security considerations;
  </li>
  <li>
    identified capital improvements for sections of the Valdez-to-Little Tonsina
    pilot segment where the route is discontinuous (e.g., two large river
    crossings), and, working with trail consultants, estimated the cost of those
    capital improvements;
  </li>
  <li>
    planned an open house in Valdez to broaden the community conversation on the
    Trans-Alaska Trail idea.
  </li>
</ul>
