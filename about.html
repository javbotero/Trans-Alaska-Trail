<p>The Trans-Alaska Trail project is a partnership between the office of
Representative Jonathan Kreiss-Tomkins (where project planning began in November
2014), Valdez-based economic diversification organization Levitation 49, and
collaborators across Alaska and the United States. The team of collaborators
continues to grow with each passing month.</p>

<p>A huge cadre of people &mdash; agency staff and leadership at Alaska DNR and BLM,
GIS techs at the University of Alaska Fairbanks, trail experts and consultants
in Alaska and throughout the U.S., graphic designers, architects, and more &mdash;
have lent time and expertise to vet and develop the Trans-Alaska Trail vision.
Energized by the vision, all private sector collaborators have worked pro
bono.</p>

<p>After 17 months of diligence and hundreds (going on thousands) of hours of
work, we’ve determined the Trans-Alaska Trail is viable and merits further
investment of effort and resources. In the fall of 2016, we have sought to
answer the myriad questions and concerns that produced in the past year and a
half . We’re excited to find those answers,  continuing on the path forward to
solutions,  which will require inclusive and collaborative stakeholder work,
especially with Alyeska.</p>
