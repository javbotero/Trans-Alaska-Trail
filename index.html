subhead: The Trans-Alaska Trail
---

  <p>What if Alaska had a world-class “destination trail”? What if we could draw hikers,
mountain bikers, and cross-country skiers to traverse tundra, taiga, temperate rainforest,
and the majestic mountains and glaciers of the Brooks Range, Alaska Range, and Chugach
Mountains &mdash; and cast a halo of outdoor recreation economy wherever they roam?</p>

<h3>The poetry of the idea? This trail already exists.</h3>

<p>The Trans-Alaska Trail — Alaska’s version of the Appalachian and Pacific Crest
Trails — is an ocean-to-ocean multi-use trail spanning 800 miles across Alaska, from
Arctic Ocean to Pacific tidewater, from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. Though not well known or
advertised, a gravel path already traverses Alaska from the Arctic Ocean to the Pacific.</p>

<p>A basic 4x4 track, or “service pad,” follows the
route of the Trans-Alaska Pipeline (TAPS) and is used by
Alyeska Pipeline Service Company (“Alyeska”) to main-
tain the pipeline infrastructure.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the TAPS right-of-way is
public land. Of the 800-mile right-of-way, 375 miles are
federal, 344 State of Alaska, 51 Alaska Native, and 30 pri-
vate. Alyeska manages right-of-way leases from Bureau
of Land Management (BLM) and Alaska Department of
Natural Resources (DNR). The leases do not preclude
recreational use of the right-of-way. In fact, nearly the
entire length of the 4x4 track is already available for
recreational use on a case-by-case basis with a “Letter of
Non-Objection” from Alyeska.</p>

<p>This is a classic “do more with what we have”
idea: creatively use existing infrastructure to create new
value, improve Alaskans’ quality of life, and create an an-
chor attraction for Alaska’s rapidly developing adventure
tourism economy.</p>

<p>It is important to clarify that the Trans-Alaska
Trail is not a capital-“W” wilderness trail. While the
TAPS right-of-way is often isolated and feels remote,
the corridor always runs in proximity to a highway. The
Trans-Alaska Trail idea is analogous to the wildly success-
ful “rails-to-trails” corridors in the Lower 48. (Multi-use
rail-trails are converted from abandoned railroad rights-
of-way.)</p>
