        <h1 class="page-title">The Trans-Alaska Trail</h1>
        <p>What if Alaska had a world-class destination trail? What if we could draw
hikers, mountain bikers, and cross-country skiers from around the world to
travel across  the tundra, taiga, temperate rainforest of Alaska, and traverse
the mountains and glaciers of the Brooks Range, Alaska Range, and Chugach
Mountains?</p>

<h3>We can. The poetry of the idea? This trail already exists. </h3>

<p>The Trans-Alaska Trail &mdash; Alaska’s version of the Appalachian and Pacific Crest
Trails &mdash; is an ocean-to-ocean multi-use trail spanning 800 miles across Alaska,
from Arctic Ocean to Pacific tidewater, from Prudhoe Bay to Valdez. It may not
be well known or advertised, but a gravel path already traverses Alaska from the
Arctic to the Pacific Ocean.</p>

<p>A basic 4x4 track, or “service pad,” follows the route of the Trans-Alaska
Pipeline and is used by Alyeska Pipeline Service Company to maintain its
infrastructure.</p>

<p>The vast majority of the route is public land. Of the 800-mile right-of-way, 375
miles are federal (Bureau of Land Management, or BLM), 344 State of Alaska
(managed by Department of Natural Resources, or DNR), 51 Alaska Native, and 30
private. Alyeska manages right-of-way leases through BLM andDNR. These leases do
not preclude recreational use of the right-of-wayand presently the route is
already available for recreational use on a case-by-case basis through a “Letter
of Non-Objection” from Alyeska.</p>

<p>While the  route is often isolated and feels remote, it  always runs in
proximity to the Richardson Highway. The proposed 66-mile pilot segment runs
from Valdez to the Little Tonsina area, near 63 mile. Hikers, bikers, and skiers
can enjoy hot showers, good food, and warm beds at fourthe Rendezvous, Tiekel,
Tonsina, and Tsaina Lodges located  along the way, a modern-day “lodge-to-lodge”
version of the roadhouse system that once sheltered pioneers traveling the
Richardson Trail., where m . The vision for the Trans-Alaska Trail will spark
excitement across Alaska and the nation, serving as a world-class outdoor
recreation destination and high-octane additive for Alaska’s rapidly developing
adventure tourism economy. the vision for the Trans-Alaska Trail.</p>
